# Placement-Package-Predictor

Project Website - https://placementpackagepredictor.streamlit.app/

This project focuses on predicting the placement package of students based on their academic scores, technical skills, non-technical skills, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide insights into the potential salary range a student can expect upon placement.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains comprehensive data about students, including their academic scores, technical skills, non-technical skills, and more. It is anonymized and carefully curated to maintain privacy and confidentiality.

# Methodology
We employed the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm for this prediction task. SVR is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can handle complex relationships between features and target variables, making it suitable for predicting placement packages.

# Project Architecture:

User interface- Streamlit

Backend - Python

Machine Learning Algorithm - Simple Vectore Machine. 

# Results
The SVR model achieved promising results in predicting the placement package of students. The evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared, demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the model. We encourage you to review the results and interpret them in the context of your specific use case.

# Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or new features to propose, please feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance the accuracy and robustness of the placement package prediction model.

I hope this README provides a clear overview of your project, its purpose, and how to use it. Customize it further to include additional information that is specific to your project.
